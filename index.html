            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jim Caddick. Only at the start of 2022 I had zero knowledge of coding but decided to make a positive change in my life and go for something much more fulfilling. My journey started with IT Career Switch and then onto Codecademy where I am studying to become a full stack developer. This is a project set by Codecademy as part of the Full-Stack Engineer course, I hope this can be a good example for people down the line.</p>
