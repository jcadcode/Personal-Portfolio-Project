# Personal-Portfolio-Project
Codecademy project 2 out of 5 from the Full Stack Engineer course

For this project my aim was to code a portfolio with using javaScript.

As I have never tested my grid skills I planned to use it on the header that contains my profile picture, nav and a 'about me' section.

Underneath is a section for the languages and skills I'll be picking up during the Full Stack Engineer course. I am using javaScript to show a description of the languages as I hover over the matching logos. Just as grid, I have never writen my own javaScript code and connecting it to a HTML page.

This project was a great learning experience for me, testing grid and putting javaScript to good use instead of following steps in lessons. Has definitely made javaScript make a lot more sense.
